    <h1>This is my HW1 Assignment</h1>
    <p>
        The main thing that I hope to gain from this class is the <emphasis>ability</emphasis> to make webpages.
        I feel like <strong>Web Development</strong> is an important skill, so I hope that I will be able to make good looking webpages.
        I have done HTML before, but never Javascript and CSS so it would be great to learn them.
